           Extension Manager, meaning installation is more-standard, and
           we now have full uninstall.  The <a href="/installation.html">download</a> should still work just
           fine in older FireFox versions, but please 
           <a href="/bugs.html">let me know</a> of any problems.
        </p>
    </dd>

        <dt>v 0.7 - Feb 23, 2004</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Added a new preference - "ieview.ieapp".  This can be set to the full path of Internet Explorer, as in:</p>

<pre>
    user_pref("ieview.ieapp", "d:\\program files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe");
</pre>

        <p>in those instances where the IEView extension cannot find Internet Explorer on its own.  Alternatively,
        you can specify an entirely different browser (AvantBrowser, Opera, Lynx) to be launched instead).</p>

        <p>In Mozilla Firefox, this preference is settable via the Tools | Options | Extensions panel -- just select
        IE View from the list, then hit the Options button to configure.</p>

        <p>If left blank, IEView searches for Internet Explorer as always.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>v 0.4 - Oct 14, 2003</dt>
    <dd>Checking the Quick Launch bar folder if we can't find IE in the Start Menu.  Thanks to 
    Philip Gabbert for the heads-up on this possibility.</dd>

    <dt>v 0.3 - Oct 10, 2003</dt>
    <dd>Now searches the entire Start Menu for IE.  Fixes problems when IE was moved from its default menu location.
    Thanks to John Kastler for the bug report and testing.</dd>

    <dt>v 0.2 - Oct 9, 2003</dt>
