<h5 class="page-header"><a id="content" name="content">IE View on Linux</a></h5>

<p>IE View is only supported, built for, and tested under Windows.  Our user community has stepped
   up with suggestions for making it work under various Linux setups.
   
<p>Jonathan Ernst offers setup notes on running IE from Firefox via <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I reproduced what is made for mozilla on my distribution (gentoo):</p>

  <ol>
  <li>
   put a script in /usr/libexec/iexplore-launcher with the following content:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

main() {
  wine "c:\program files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.exe" "$@" &
  return 1;
}

# Call the main sub, which is defined at the top of this script
main "$@"
</pre>
</li>

          <li><p>put a link in <code>/usr/bin</code> that links to the script:</p>


<pre>
ln -s /usr/libexec/iexplore-launcher /usr/bin/iexplore
</pre>
   </li>

   <li>
       set <code>/usr/bin/iexplore</code> in ie view configuration - and everything works !
   </li>
 </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>And Adam Howard notes that this works for him under Crossover Office 3.x / Slackware 10.0:</p>

<blockquote>
    I had to adjust the line in <code>/usr/libexec/iexplore-launch</code> to this (all on one line):

    <pre>"/opt/cxoffice/bin/wine" --check --cx-app "C:////Program Files////Internet Explorer////IEXPLORE.EXE" "$@" &amp;</pre> 
</blockquote>

<p>Most recently, David had this to say:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://mozdev.org/pipermail/ieview/2006-December/000128.html">

    <p>Many of us Linux web designers use <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">IEs4Linux</a> as a convenient way to
    install and run IE 5.0, 5.5, and IE6 (IE7 support is in progress). One
    difference is that IEs4Linux doesn't do a full WINE install and
    configuration, it just does what's needed to run the different IE versions.</p>
    
    <p>I had to modify the iexplore-launcher script by replacing:</p>
    
    <p><code>wine "c:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" "$@" &amp;</code></p>
    
    <p>with the path and executable that IEs4Linux uses to launch IE6:</p>
    
    <p><code>/home/[your user id]/bin/ie6 "$@" &amp;</code></p>
