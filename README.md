To install the latest release version of IE View, visit the [Firefox Add-Ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ie-view/).

Currently in the process of moving the project to github from [Mozdev](http://ieview.mozdev.org/).

For the moment, I'd look there for [IE View bug tracking](http://ieview.mozdev.org/bugs.html), etc.
